## Sum of a sequence ()
#Your task is to make function, which returns the sum of a sequence of integers.
#The sequence is defined by 3 non-negative values: begin, end, step.
#If begin value is greater than the end, function should returns 0
#
#Examples
#sequenceSum(2,2,2) === 2
#sequenceSum(2,6,2) === 12 // 2 + 4 + 6
#sequenceSum(1,5,1) === 15 // 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
#sequenceSum(1,5,3) === 5 // 1 + 4

## My solution:
def sequence_sum(begin_number, end_number, step):
    a = 1
    c = 0
    while begin_number <= end_number:
        c += begin_number
        begin_number = begin_number + step
        print(c)
    return(c)
    
## Best Solution:
def sequence_sum(begin_number, end_number, step):
    return sum(range(begin_number, end_number+1, step))
